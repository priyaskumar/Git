Workflow
===

### **_Github workflow_**  

write code  ->  commit changes  ->  make a pull request 
    
      
### **_Local git workflow_**  

write code  ->  stage changes (git add)  ->  commit changes (git commit) ->  push changes (git push) ->   make a pull request  
                    
            
### **_When is Local Git Workflow Worth the Additional Complexity?_**

  * When there're discrete named or numbered releases.
  * When there's a need to freeze development on a release candidate while still continuing to develop and integrate features for a subsequent release. 
  * When multiple versions of the software need to be supported and maintained independently.

### **_An extra edge to Github Workflow_**

  * Github Workflow used for most of the projects. 
  * Provides almost all the functionality that Git Workflow does.
  * Is scaled back for a more adaptable workflow with less overhead.
